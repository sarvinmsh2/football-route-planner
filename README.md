# World Cup 2026 Travel Route Planner

Unosquare Graduate / Junior SWE Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a system that helps FIFA World Cup 2026 fans plan optimal travel routes between host cities based on match schedules. The tournament spans **48 teams**, **16 cities**, and **3 countries** (USA, Mexico, Canada).

See [CHALLENGE.md](./CHALLENGE.md) for `The Scenario` and full instructions.

**NOTE**: Clone this repository and copy the contents into a new repository for your account. Please share your Github URL when you are done. 

We recommend spending a maximum 2-3 hours on the challenge (excluding setup); however the time spent is entirely up to the individual.

## A Note on AI Assistance

We encourage the use of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help you complete these tasks — this reflects how modern developers work.

However, **understanding matters more than output**. During review, you may be asked to:
- Explain your code and the decisions you made
- Walk through of implementation
- Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches

Use AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement for understanding. The goal is to demonstrate your problem-solving ability and grasp of the concepts.

## Requirements

You are expected to complete the following:

1. **Implement API endpoints** — Choose one backend (Node/Express, Java/Spring, Python/Flask, or .NET) and implement all REST endpoints ** node express chosen for the backend with changes implemented**
2. **Implement route optimisation** — Build a `NearestNeighbourStrategy` using the Strategy Pattern
3. **Write unit tests** — Add tests to verify your route optimisation algorithm
4. **Implement frontend map component** — Build a `<RouteMap />` component using react-leaflet
5. **Document your approach** — Add comments explaining your reasoning and any trade-offs

```

### Additional Pre-requisites

Each project has its own runtime requirements. See the relevant README:

- **Frontend:** Node.js v20+ — see [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md)
- **Node/Express:** Node.js v20+ — see [`backend/node-express/README.md`](backend/node-express/README.md)
- **Java/Spring:** Java 21+ — see [`backend/java-spring/README.md`](backend/java-spring/README.md)
- **Python/Flask:** Python 3.10+ — see [`backend/python-flask/README.md`](backend/python-flask/README.md)
- **.NET:** .NET 8 SDK — see [`backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md`](backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md)

## Getting Started

See each project's README for detailed setup instructions:

- **Frontend:** [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md)
- **Node/Express:** [`backend/node-express/README.md`](backend/node-express/README.md)
- **Java/Spring:** [`backend/java-spring/README.md`](backend/java-spring/README.md)
- **Python/Flask:** [`backend/python-flask/README.md`](backend/python-flask/README.md)
- **.NET:** [`backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md`](backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md)

## Testing APIs

A Postman collection is provided to help test your API endpoints.

See [`postman/README.md`](postman/README.md) for detailed import and usage instructions.

### Quick Start

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Import [`postman/WorldCup2026_API.postman_collection.json`](postman/WorldCup2026_API.postman_collection.json)
3. Start your backend server on port 3008
4. Run requests from the collection

### Available Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Task |
|--------|----------|------|
| GET | `/api/cities` | #1 |
| GET | `/api/matches` | #2 |
| GET | `/api/matches/:id` | #2 |
| POST | `/api/route/optimise` | #3 |
| POST | `/api/route/budget` | #5 |
| POST | `/api/route/best-value` | Bonus |
| POST | `/api/itineraries` | Pre-built |
| GET | `/api/itineraries/:id` | Pre-built |

The collection uses `http://localhost:3008` as the base URL.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | What We Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
